I recently completed my Bachelor's thesis, where I used a Deep Neural Network to predict the next solar cycle. My research was focused on finding a reliable method to forecast solar activity, which could be used to inform decisions in the energy sector. I used a variety of data sources and techniques to develop a model that could accurately predict the next solar cycle. My findings were presented in a detailed report and I am confident that this research could be used to inform decisions in the energy sector.
