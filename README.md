# CV Improver using Machine Learning
Hello :smiley: thank you for being here!

This is a Python project that will help you improving the CV using Artificial Intelligence. 
In particular, we will use the ChatGPT API to improve the __summary__ of  your CV and the AI will also review your work experience, making it more appealing for recruiters!

This project has two important applications. 
Let's  describe them

## Application script

The application script uses the __streamlit__, that is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science. 
In order to run it, once you download the folder and the ```pip install requirements.txt``` file, you have to change the ```constants.py``` file and change it with the Open AI API key. (I know its a lot to do, but it OpenAI blocks your keys when they are shared online, so you have to put yours).

If you do not have an Open AI API key, please follow the [Open AI blogpost](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)
